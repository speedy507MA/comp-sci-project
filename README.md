# Project for ECS (WHS)
Use the [index.html](https://github.com/speedy507MA/comp-sci-project/blob/main/html/index.html) file to get started.

Because I'm required to have features that make my page unique, I have some below.

* I created custom scrolling animations that utilize JavaScript and CSS to make scrolling a generally more exciting and visually pleasing experience; you can view a demo [here]().
* I added CSS hover animations to the buttons and some other things on my pages
* The [index.html](https://github.com/speedy507MA/comp-sci-project/blob/main/html/index.html) page detects whether the user is in light or dark mode and puts them in that specific page.
* The [about.html](https://github.com/speedy507MA/comp-sci-project/blob/main/html/about.html) page also uses theme detection which required more CSS to provide light and dark mode support.
* I have a TryIt feature that lets someone test the code/features that are shown on the page which utilizes:
    * CSS for the button styling
    * A custom TryIt ID so the script knows where to take you
    * JavaScript to create HTML for the TryIt and a custom HTML sanitizer to prevent injection when doing DOM manipulation.
    * The page is also opened in a new window and given a close button to make the experience better.

Overall, this project has been really fun to work on and think about, especially considering all of the unique features that I've implemented not just for UX, but for site security and stability. Even the small things are important to consider, such as scaling things to the end user's screen size.

Anyways, thanks for reading and hope you enjoy this, as I spent quite a bit of time making everything look nice for you.
